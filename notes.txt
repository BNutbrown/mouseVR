Install notes:
==============
* put virmen folder local (e.g C:/Virmen)
* replace virmenEngine.m with version in customFunctionsVR
* put transformPerspectiveMultipleScreens.m in local transforms folder
* put moveWithRotaryEncoderBruker.m in the local movements folder
* put 5WORLDS.mat and Bruker2_virmen_TCP.m in the local experiments folder
* add Virmen folder and CustomVRFunctions folder to MATLAB path

run virmen, then go Experiment>Open>5WORLDS.mat


Usage notes:
============
* runTCPserver.py must be running for matlab to connect and start the session
* NI daq devices must also be present
* As we have multiple machines runing the same code, and these machines have different NI devices, we use ComputerNIMappings.cfg file to configure which devices are used on each machine. the file must contain the current computers name and device names!


Notes
=====
lick detection as counter channel detecting rising edges. updated at same time as rotary encoder.
analog outputs to reward and photostim were causing frame drops so offloaded to a sepearte python app - connected via TCP


To do:
======
rewrite screen transform function as a C/MEX function
